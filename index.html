<h4 align = center style="font-family:impact;">Flying can be stressful. Packing bags, making your flight on time, not forgetting your passport, changing time zones, long layovers, and long lines can make flying a struggle. These are some tips to make your flying experience less of a struggle.</h4>
<h2 style = "background-color:LightSkyBlue;color:Navy;border:4px solid DodgerBlue;">1. Just Pack Less</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:impact;"><b>Your ultimate goal is to try to be able to go on a flight with just a carry on bag. But lets be honest, it is almost impossible to due that. So just try to pack the essentials. After all, no one needs 7 pairs of high heels. Also, packing less is saving you from paying high fees for "overweight" baggage.<b></p>
<h2 style = "background-color:LightSkyBlue;color:Navy;border:4px solid DodgerBlue;">2. Sign Up For TSA Precheck</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:impact;">This is something life-changing and I mean this. Security lines will no longer be a struggle. By signing up for TSA Precheck before you fly, you go through lines where individuals are not required to take their shoes off and laptops out. However, if you are not a frequent flier, TSA Precheck isn't worth your money. Just stick to the long lines and make sure to arrive at least 1 hour earlier than you're boarding time, so that you don't miss your flight. </p>
<h2 style = "background-color:LightSkyBlue;color:Navy;border:4px solid DodgerBlue;">3. Set Flight Info as Home Screen</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:impact;">When you book a flight, you will receive an email with all of the flight details. I like to screenshot that email and set it as my lockscreen. This way I don't have to go sifting through emails to find that flight information on the day that I'm flying. </p>
